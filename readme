# 🌐 Reverse Internship Platform

> A MERN + OpenAI powered platform where **startups and institutions can “intern” under retired professionals** to gain wisdom, mentorship, and consulting. Instead of letting decades of experience go untapped, this platform creates a bridge between **experience-rich retirees** and **innovation-driven organizations**.

---

## 📌 Problem

Retired professionals have vast knowledge and expertise, but after leaving the workforce, there are very few structured channels for them to contribute. Their skills often go underutilized, while startups and young institutions struggle with lack of affordable mentorship and guidance.

## 💡 Idea

* **Startups/Institutions “intern” under retired experts**.
* Retired professionals provide **mentorship, strategy, and part-time consulting**.
* AI assists in **matching, summarization, and engagement**.
